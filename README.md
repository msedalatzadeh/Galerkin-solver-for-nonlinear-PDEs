# Optimal Actuator Location for Railway Tracks
Actuator location and design are important design variables  in controller synthesis for distributed parameter systems. Finding the best actuator location to control a distributed parameter system can significantly reduce the cost of the control and improve  its effectiveness. From a theoretical point of view, the existence of an optimal actuator location has been discussed in the literature for linear partial differential equations (PDE's). It was proven that an optimal actuator location exists for linear-quadratic control.  Conditions under which using approximations in optimization yield the optimal location are also established.
